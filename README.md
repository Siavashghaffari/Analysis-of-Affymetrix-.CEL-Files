Analyzing Affy microarrays with Bioconductor to get the gene expression matrix.  CEL files the 'raw' data files produced at the end of the array scan, and are normally deposited in gene expression databases like GEO. In this example, We have CEL files of 40 Healthy patients and 40 atherosclerotic patients, and the goal is to find genes that are significantly higher in athero patients.
